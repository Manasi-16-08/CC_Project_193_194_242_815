Problem Statement 2:

Building a Task Management Application with Raft Consensus Algorithm and MySQL

Overview:

The objective of this project is to develop a task management application that utilises the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. MySQL will be employed as the backend database to store task data. The application will enable users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks across the distributed system.


Objectives:

● Implement a task management system with Raft consensus algorithm for distributed coordination.

● Utilise MySQL as the backend database to store task data.

● Ensure fault tolerance and consistency across multiple nodes using Raft.

● Enable users to perform CRUD operations on tasks via a user-friendly interface.

● Demonstrate distributed system principles and fault tolerance mechanisms through the application.


Pre-requisites:

● Raft Consensus Algorithm: Basic knowledge of Raft consensus algorithm and its implementation.

● MySQL Database: Good understanding of relational databases and experience with MySQL.

● Proficient in backend development using Python, with a basic understanding of frontend technologies for building user interfaces.
